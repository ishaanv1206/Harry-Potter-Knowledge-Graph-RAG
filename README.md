# 🧙‍♂️ Harry Potter GraphRAG using LangChain, Neo4j and LLaMA 3.3

This project leverages **LangChain**, **Neo4j**, and **LLaMA 3.3** to extract and structure information from a **Harry Potter PDF** into a queryable **graph database**. The resulting system enables users to explore rich, interlinked knowledge around **characters, spells, and events** from the wizarding world.

## ✨ Features

- 📄 Extracts structured data (entities and relationships) from unstructured text using LangChain
- 🧠 Stores extracted data in a Neo4j Graph Database for efficient graph queries
- 🗺️ Enables exploration of connections between characters, spells, places, and events
- 🔍 Supports Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) using LLaMA 3.3 for context-aware responses

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **LangChain** – for building the extraction pipeline and agent framework
- **Neo4j** – graph database to store entities and relationships
- **LLaMA 3.3** – for semantic understanding and query responses
- **Python** – main language
